# bezalel-forest-project
Joint  Visual Communication degree final project

The project explores the remarkable communication network of trees within the forest. Through an immersive and visually engaging exhibition, participants are invited to discover the diverse ways trees interact and exchange information. From underground fungal networks to chemical signaling and acoustic vibrations, the exhibition showcases the intricate methods employed by trees to communicate effectively. By actively engaging participants in the process, the project prompts reflection on their own communication capabilities and the potential for effecting significant change. It seeks to inspire individuals, drawing parallels to the profound impact that trees have through their communication within the forest
